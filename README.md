How do you manage your time: keeping a schedule and constantly checking on Canvas to make sure to do assignments on time and know my deadlines 
Do you use other methods to keep track: google calendar, excel (in community college) 
Habits as a student: after class, check canvas to do assignments and update calendar → actual schoolwork → listen to music that doesn’t involve singing → studying uses quizlet a lot and reread articles and notes i took during class. 
When you have meet ups how do you manage time: google calendar 
Does not allocate time for short assignments and do it all in one go 
No frustrations

Stella - Keo
How do you manage your time?
Google Calendar is my lifeline for organizing my day.
I struggle with estimating how long tasks will take, which can mess up my schedules.
However, my ADHD occasionally affects my ability to estimate time accurately, causing scheduling hiccups.

Do you use other methods to keep track?
I have a post-class routine of updating my schedule.
Accurately guessing task durations isn't my strong suit, leading to scheduling hiccups.

Habits as a student:
Google Calendar is my go-to for managing my time.
Prioritizing assignments and studying is a must, but time estimation, especially with ADHD, can be a challenge.
Schedules don't always match up with actual time spent on tasks.

# Current Time Management Tools: 
Throughout our research, we found that many college students utilize Google Calendar or Notion to manage their time and assignments. Google Calendar is a calendar that strives to focus on time management and scheduling, while Notion is a software focused on visual time management and productivity for assignments or projects. 


# The Problem: 
Students underestimate the time it takes for them to complete an assignment


# Why our app? 
Our app took inspiration from Google Calendar, but what is different is that we implement AI to determine how long the student usually takes to complete certain tasks. Doing so generates a more accurate time frame for students to complete their assignments. Additionally, a unique feature that our app has is that users can import their tasks either from Canvas or another platform. Since Google Calendar and Notion do not remind students to take breaks when completing assignments, our app makes sure to send notifications to students while they are doing homework to remind them that it is time for a scheduled break. 



# Our Design Process 
To generate potential ideas for our app’s design, each team member individually created paper wireframes. After reviewing one another’s work, we met to discuss the features that would be most crucial to the functionality of the app. We each drew stars next to the components of the designs that we liked, and we circled the ones that we wanted to include in our prototype. Once we determined the user flow, we then translated our wireframes onto Figma.
