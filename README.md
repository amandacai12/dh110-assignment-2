Digital Humanities 110 Assignment 2 Time Management Interface

# Student Chat
Amanda - Roommate, Comm major
How do you manage your time: keeping a schedule and constantly checking on Canvas to make sure to do assignments on time and know my deadlines 
Do you use other methods to keep track: google calendar, excel (in community college) 
Habits as a student: after class, check canvas to do assignments and update calendar → actual schoolwork → listen to music that doesn’t involve singing → studying uses quizlet a lot and reread articles and notes i took during class. 
When you have meet ups how do you manage time: google calendar 
Does not allocate time for short assignments and do it all in one go 
No frustrations
