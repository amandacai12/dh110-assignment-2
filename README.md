Amanda - Roommate, Comm major
How do you manage your time: keeping a schedule and constantly checking on Canvas to make sure to do assignments on time and know my deadlines 
Do you use other methods to keep track: google calendar, excel (in community college) 
Habits as a student: after class, check canvas to do assignments and update calendar → actual schoolwork → listen to music that doesn’t involve singing → studying uses quizlet a lot and reread articles and notes i took during class. 
When you have meet ups how do you manage time: google calendar 
Does not allocate time for short assignments and do it all in one go 
No frustrations

Stella - Keo
How do you manage your time?
Google Calendar is my lifeline for organizing my day.
I struggle with estimating how long tasks will take, which can mess up my schedules.
However, my ADHD occasionally affects my ability to estimate time accurately, causing scheduling hiccups.

Do you use other methods to keep track?
I have a post-class routine of updating my schedule.
Accurately guessing task durations isn't my strong suit, leading to scheduling hiccups.

Habits as a student:
Google Calendar is my go-to for managing my time.
Prioritizing assignments and studying is a must, but time estimation, especially with ADHD, can be a challenge.
Schedules don't always match up with actual time spent on tasks.
